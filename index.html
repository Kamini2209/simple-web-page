    <h1 class="ab">WEB DEVELOPMENT </h1>
    <p>
        Web development is the process of building, programming, and maintaining websites and web applications. Website developers use various programming languages, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to develop websites and web applications. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.<br>
        Websites consist of two parts: the front end, which users experience, and the back end, which comprises the invisible structure making the front end possible. The frontend is what your users see and includes visual elements like buttons, checkboxes, graphics, and text messages. It allows your users to interact with your application. The backend is the data and infrastructure that make your application work. It stores and processes application data for your users. Full-stack developers work with all parts of a website and use front-end and back-end coding skills.<br><br>

They're called “languages” because they include vocabulary and grammatical rules for communicating with computers. They also include special commands, abbreviations, and punctuation that can only be read by devices and programs.

    <h1 class="ab">FRONT-END DEVELOPER</h1>
    <p >
        Front-end development focuses on the user-facing side of a website. Front-end developers ensure that visitors can easily interact with and navigate sites by using programming languages, design skills, and other tools. They produce the drop-down menus, layouts, and designs for websites.<br>
        Front-end devs use computer programming languages like JavaScript, HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to design websites. Each language serves a unique purpose. HTML lays out the site's content and structure, CSS adds design features, and JavaScript creates advanced interactive features. Less commonly, front-end devs know other programming languages like Python, PHP, or Ruby.<br><br>

    <h1 class="ab">BACK-END DEVELOPER</h1>
    <p>
        Back-end developers focus on the server side of websites. The back end includes an application, server, and database. Back-end developers are the experts who build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions on websites. <br>
        Back-end devs use tools like SQL Server and Oracle to store, organize, and change data. Employers often require expertise with PHP frameworks, version control software, and debugging back-end systems and applications. Back-end devs collaborate with front-end developers, management, and business stakeholders to understand each project's goals.<br><br>
